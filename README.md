# Postman Collection for PosDealer

## Introduction

This repository contains material for in-house training to introduce the PosDealer Postman Collection. The training illustrates the use of API keys as variables, along with a fixed search term using Spoonacular.

## Original PosDealer Collection

The original PosDealer Collection and documentation can be found [here](https://docs.fiskaltrust.cloud/de/apis/posdealer-api).

## Customizations

In this repository, the PosDealer Collection is supplemented with variables (API-Key and AccessToken) from a test account. Additionally, pre-request scripts have been added to enhance functionality.

### Added Variables

- **API-Key:** Variable for secure authentication.
- **AccessToken:** Variable for enhanced authorization.

### Pre-request Scripts

To streamline the testing process, pre-request scripts have been incorporated. These scripts provide random data, preventing time loss during value entry and minimizing error messages due to pre-existing data.
